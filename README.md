## Idea 2
crosschain data transfer registry mumbo jumbo smth

### Architecture decisions
- 2 testnet chains that are not mantle
- we do NOT refresh data on each dst contract read (assumption data doesn't have to be fresh)

### Tasks to do
- [ ] src chain registry contract - Kai
- [ ] dst chain receiver registry contract - Kai / Hugo
- [ ] figure out crosschain calls - Hugo
- [ ] (opt) bitmap for gas efficiency - maybe Hugo
- [ ] (opt) permissionless property adding - maybe Kai
- [ ] demo js script - Hugo
- [ ] logistics: video, presentation, devfolio submission - together











=======
## TODO:
- [x] src chain registry contract - Kai
- [x] dst chain receiver registry contract - Kai / Hugo
- [ ] figure out crosschain calls - Hugo
- [ ] (opt) bitmap for gas efficiency - maybe Hugo - WONTDO (not necessary)
- [ ] (opt) permissionless property adding - maybe Kai - 
- [ ] demo js script - Hugo - WONTDO (we do website instead)
- [ ] webpage - Hugo
- [ ] webpage on IPFS - Hugo
- [ ] logistics: video, presentation, devfolio submission - together
